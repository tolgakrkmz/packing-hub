# Package Hub

An offline production dashboard built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
It helps plan shift teams, assign pair targets, record production and downtime,
and review monthly results without a backend or build step.

**Portfolio demonstration: every employee, production record and packing
instruction in this repository is fictional. No company documents are included.**

## Features

- Production and scrap logging with monthly history and totals.
- Line downtime reports with causes and monthly breakdowns.
- Personnel management and a shared rotating shift schedule.
- Pair targets in kilograms and crates, actual output and reasons for missed goals.
- Automatic shift selection at 06:00, 14:00 and 22:00; overnight shifts retain their start date.
- Packing instructions with search and a fictional sample profile.
- Monthly statistics and compact file connection panels.

The interface is currently in Bulgarian. Source filenames and this README are
in English. The pair targets module opens directly without a role login.

## Run locally

1. Download or clone the repository into a separate demo folder.
2. Open `index.html` in Chrome or Edge. No installation or internet connection is required.
3. Connect the corresponding JSON fixtures from `data/` when opening a module.
4. For Pair Targets, select both `pair-targets.json` and `personnel.json`.
5. For Statistics, select the production, downtime and personnel fixtures.
6. For Packing Instructions, select the repository folder containing `data/`.

Some management screens use the public demonstration password **`demo-admin`**.
This is a browser UI toggle, not a security boundary. Permissions to read or
write files are provided by the browser and operating system.

Only use the fictional demo files. File connections are remembered in IndexedDB
and refresh every 20 seconds. Saving changes modifies the selected local files.
The demo uses separate browser storage names to avoid loading existing production
connections. Browsers without direct file access use manual import/export.

## Technical choices

- Plain scripts support opening the project through `file://` without module CORS issues.
- File System Access API for user-selected local files and folders.
- IndexedDB for remembered handles; local storage for manual import/export fallback.
- Shared shift scheduling and a separately validated pair-target data model.
- Production and pair reports stay separate to avoid counting output twice.
- JSON storage is intended for a small local workflow. Multiple writers are not
  coordinated by a transactional server; concurrent saves can still conflict.

## Tests

With Node.js 20 or newer:

```sh
node --test tests/*.test.cjs
```

The tests cover shift boundaries, rotation, pair allocation, target validation,
report scope, failure reasons, read-only personnel access and stale file refreshes.

## Project structure

- `*.html`: independent application screens.
- `css/`: shared theme and screen styles.
- `js/`: application logic, file access and shared models.
- `data/`: reviewed fictional fixtures only.
- `tests/`: Node.js tests for scheduling, pair targets and file synchronization.

## Publication

This repository contains a sanitized portfolio snapshot. No distribution license
has been selected. Never replace these fixtures with real personnel, customer documents or factory
records in a commit. Removing a file in a later commit does not erase its history.
